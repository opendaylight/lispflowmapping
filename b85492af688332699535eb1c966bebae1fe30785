      "message": "In general, \"grouping \" is useful if it is used in multiple places. If it is only used in one place, then it doesnt have to be a grouping, and can be defined in place. eid-list is only used here, so maybe you can define the list here inside the input and avoid defining the eid-list grouping. Unless it is serving a specific purpose in the code, I think we should aim for simplicity of the model.",

      "message": "Again, I dont think list of keys without eid association is useful. In general use of RESTCONF for adding/updating data is strictly preferable, because RPC hides the tree hierarchy,preventing tail-f to do transactions /reverts. So now that our model is more stable, moving forward we should only use RESTCONF for adding/updating data. RPC is requried only for gettng, because of longest prefix match.  and not to complicate the models too much, I think we dont need to add too many RPCs in an exahustive way. After API freeze we can still add RPCs if we want I think if needed, we just cant change the existing published API.",
