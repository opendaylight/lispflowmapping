      "message": "You are checking the smr twice here, the saveRlocs() already takes smr into account. I think it would be cleaner if you remove the smr from saveRlocks() so it always returns true if new records are being saved. And then check for smr in the if above as you do now. The way it is right now, saveRlocks() may have better performance if smr is false, but I suspect the gain would be negligible.",

      "message": "While I haven\u0027t measured performance to be able to comment on the impact, I still prefer to leave smr in saveRlocs(), otherwise we have two DAO lookups for each map-register instead of one.  If we have lots of ETRs registering, that may be signifiant, and fix is simple :)\n\nWhat we can do to make it cleaner/more elegant, is call the argument \"checkForMappingChange\" or something like that instead of \"smr\".\n\nEven then, I would still check for smr in the if statement, to make things less confusing, as this really has no performance impact.",
