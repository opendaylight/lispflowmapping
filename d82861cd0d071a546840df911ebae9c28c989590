      "message": "referring to the LISP RFC - SMR section, the ITR RLOC is only used as a security measure and not as a destination for corresponding SMR-invoked Map-Request. The RFC says if ITR RLOC of a SMR is not same as one of the RLOCs cached locally at the xTR, the xTR must send the SMR-invoked Map-Request to the Mapping System. So basically I think finding the best local address is not really needed. Any local address should do, since it wont be used for reachability. What may be used for reachability is either the Mapping System, or the Source RLOC of the SMR message (only if ITR RLOC passes the security check above, which in our case will never pass).",
