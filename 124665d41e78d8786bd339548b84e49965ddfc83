      "message": "This part looks good now, however as discussed in the comments on patch set 1, because of the security risk this will introduce, at least I think it should be configurable, so it can be turned off. You can take a look at ConfigIni.java under the implementation bundle for examples of making a feature configurable. I think we can move forward with this once the config option is added.",
