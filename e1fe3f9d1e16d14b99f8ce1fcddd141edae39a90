Additionally, it should be possible to change these values at run-time with JMX, although I haven\u0027t tested that (and that may require some extra wiring). LfmMappingServiceSbModule is setting this to LispSouthboundPlugin, and I tested that when I put false here, the Map-Register cache is disabled.",
