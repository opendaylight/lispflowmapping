      "message": "The workings of the DAO is not really described in any type of comments, Javadoc or otherwise.  I think that at least for new code, we should add a bit of explanatory comments.  It may be obvious to us that SrcDstLcaf needs a recursive or inner data structure, but I think this is one of those things that should be documented somewhere.  I\u0027m not sure if this function is the best place, but it\u0027s one option.\n\nI would eventually add a Javadoc style comment to the whole AbstractLispComponent class, to explain things happening here but for this commit, just documenting the above should be great.",
