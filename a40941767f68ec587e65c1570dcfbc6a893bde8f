      "message": "timeStampIsExpired() returns boolean, and if the timestamp is null, the the return value is meaningless. So passing null to that function should never happen. I added Preconditions to check for that, but that will still throw an exception, and the code causing it needs to be fixed. I didn\u0027t put a null check on line 236, since MappingRecords stored in SimpleMapCache are created by a serializer, which sets the timestamp always. But a check there wouldn\u0027t hurt either, so I\u0027ll do that.",
