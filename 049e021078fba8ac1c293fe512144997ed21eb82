      "message": "Old mapping is an NB mapping in these, while it is an SB mapping in the next three. Wondering why, and if we should replicate such that 5 tests are done for : old mapping from NB, new mapping  from SB, and vice versa, and both are from NB and both are from SB? should be mostly copy paste of the tests with minor changes, but they will exercise different parts of code, unless you think some combinations test the same code path..Also, probably this (NB/SB) can be indicated in the names..",

      "message": "To the first point: old mapping is a negative SB mapping, but it is not installed explicitly, but instead it is \"generated\" by querying for a hole between two NB mappings, adding a subscriber in the process. This exercises more code and is more \"realistic\".\n\nTo the second point, I added many more combinations, which are listed in a testing matrix in Google Sheets, and I folded the NB specific patch into this one, to have everything in one place.",
