This folder contains the supporting files for the Hydrogen release tutorial
[1].  The demo/tutorial show how to use the LISP Flow Mapping project in
cunjunction with two open source LISP data plane implementations: LISPmob and
Open vSwitch.  The demo was first delivered at the February 2014 OpenDaylight
Summit, and the slides are available at [2].

Here's a short description of each file:

ODL_Summit_LISP_Demo.json - This is a collection of northbound API requests
    that can be imported into the Postman Chrome extension.  While the
    tutorial shows how to use cURL for talking to the northbound REST API, it
    is much more convenient to use Postman.

lispd.conf.{client|server1} - The lispd.conf configuration files used on the
    client and server1 VMs running LISPmob
